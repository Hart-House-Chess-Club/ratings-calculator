# ratings-calculator
Calculate ratings based on the CFC model. 

## Why 
This program was created to calculate CFC ratings for our members. A future implementation would be in embeding this information onto a web service that will automatically calculate ratings. Another idea is to build a HHCC rating system to let our members play each other in-person. 

## About
Started in Fall 2022 with HHCC Execs Victor Zheng.
