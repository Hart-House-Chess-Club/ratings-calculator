# ratings-calculator
Calculate ratings based on the CFC model. 

## Why 
This program was created to calculate CFC ratings for our members. A future implementation would be in embeding this information onto a web service that will automatically calculate ratings. Another idea is to build a HHCC rating system to let our members play each other in-person. 

## About

Started in Fall 2022 with Hart House Chess Club Executive Board member Victor Zheng. 

Updated in December 2023.

## How 
This program runs by calculating CFC ratings from the publicly accessible CFC algorithm viewable on the [CFC handbook](https://github.com/Hart-House-Chess-Club/ratings-calculator/blob/main/CFC%20-%20CFC%20Handbook%20(to%202014).pdf). 

A future goal is to use the public CFC API to connect to user's CFC ID and run various algorithms to automate the finding user data aspect.
